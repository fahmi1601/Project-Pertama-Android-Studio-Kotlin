Ciro Amore, president of ASD Napoli, was his first manager. Mauro Bianchessi snatched him from Inter in extremis six years later.\n" +
            "During the first training session of 2013 and his first appearances with the Rossonero youth team, he immediately stunned all the youth sector instructors. Coach Mihajlović introduced him to the Serie A in October 2015, the 1999-born player has already reached 200 appearances in official games with AC Milan. He's already one of AC Milan's pillars and also of the Italian senior national team, his human profile is constantly maturing. A strong bond with his brother Antonio, Gigio is constantly growing, even on the pitch.",
        "A promising youngster born in 1997 (185 cm and 79 kg), born in Canada but a naturalised British citizen. His name is written Oluwafikayomi Oluwadamilolo \"Fikayo\" Tomori and he's centre-back - but can also play on the right - with great physical attributes and good technical skills. From Chelsea to Chelsea, blue has been the colour in his career until now; he came through the West London side's academy, he made his First Team debut in May 2016 and returned to the club after three loan spells in the Championship with Brighton & Hove Albion, Hull City and Derby County. A total of 114 appearances and four goals. With England, he won the U20 World Cup (South Korea 2017) and has already made his first team debut for the Three Lions. Now, AC Milan.",
        "Considered one of the greatest talents of his generation, the defender who is a native of Anzio and current captain of AC Milan, moved to Roma aged 8 after growing up in the youth sector of his city team. He made his debut in the first team, under the technical guidance of Zdeněk Zeman, in the Coppa Italia match against Atalanta, while the following year, he made his Serie A debut in the match won by Roma 4-2 against AC Milan.\n" +
                "In the 2014/2015 season, on loan to Sampdoria, he made 30 appearances and scored two goals. Strongly sought after by former AC Milan coach Siniša Mihajlović, in the summer of 2015 he moved to AC Milan, where, after just 3 years, he became the second youngest captain in Rossonero history, only trailing behind the legend bearing the name of Franco Baresi.",
    "After taking his first steps as a player in the youth sector of Virtus Adrense, Davide, was selected by Rossoneri observers at the age of 11. He made his debut as a halfback in the Beginner (Esordienti) category, immediately showing his skills in both phases and with two excellent feet. In 2014, he arrived in the Primavera squad and Calabria became one of AC Milan's pillars that won the Viareggio Tournament under Filippo Inzaghi.\n" +
            "He made his debut in the first team and in Serie A on May 30th, 2015, aged 18. The following season he won his first professional trophy, the Italian Super Cup won on penalties against Juventus. The call to the National team arrived shortly after, April 9th, 2017, after several convincing performances with the minor national teams.",
        "Matteo Gabbia was born in Busto Arsizio on 21 October 1999. He joined the Rossoneri youth setup in 2012 and represented the club in regional youth leagues. On 24 August 2017, he made his first team debut in the Europa League against KF Shk‘ndija. After impressing for the reserves, he was loaned to Serie C side Lucchese for the 2018/19 season, before returning to Milan. He has represented Italy from the age of 14 and was one of the captains of the national side during the U20 World Cup. He is now an integral part of Nicolato's U21 Italian side. ",
        "Jens Petter Hauge came onto the Club's radar shortly before the third round of Europa League qualification in 2020/21. The young Norwegian scored for Bodø/Glimt to make it 3-2 at San Siro. That was enough to convince AC Milan to bring him in within the space of a week. He went from opponent to an added resource.\n" +
                "Born in 1999, he’s a quick and highly technical attacker. Hauge rose through the ranks at Bodø/Glimt before breaking into the first team in 2016. After 67 appearances and nine goals, he went out on loan to Aalesund in 2018. He then returned to Glimt, where he made 51 more appearances and scored 26 goals over the course of his next two seasons. After joining AC Milan, he also received his first call-up to the Norway national team.",
        "Hakan was born in Mannheim, a city on the banks of the Rhine in southern Germany, from a family of Trebisondese origins. He was born and raised in Mannheim, but at the age of 15 he was selected by Karlsruhe, a team that made him debut in Zweite Liga (Second German League), which launched him into the world of adults: Hamburg observers then selected him.\n" +
                "The Lower Saxony team makes him debut immediately in the Bundesliga, a season in which Hakan makes 34 league appearances and scores 11 goals. The experience at Bayer Leverkusen opens the doors of the Champions League to the Turkish footballer, playing continuously with the red & black jersey and scoring 17 goals. He was then signed by another Rossonero team in 2017, AC Milan.",
        "Originally from Foča, a small town in eastern Bosnia and Herzegovina, Rade began his footballing career in his local football squad, Sutjeska Foča, which made him debut in the first team. He then moved to Serbia and played for Donji Srem, the Bosnian talent played more than 50 games with convincing performances." +
                "After a brief spell at Borac Čačak, a team that always plays in the Serbian championship, he was signed by Marco Giampaolo's Empoli, which made him debut in Serie A. His is a constant crescendo, with the maximum peak reached in the 2018/2019 season, where he scores 5 goals and 7 assists. His transfer to AC Milan was officialised in the summer of 2019.",
        "Franck Yannick Kessié was born in Ouragahio, a city in the Ivory Coast, in December 1996. He began his career as a central defensive player at the Stella Club d'Adjamé youth team, which plays in Ivory Coast's first division, where he also made his debut in the first team.\n" +
                "He was born with the myth of Yaya Touré and Essien, in his first Italian season on loan at Cesena from Atalanta; he played as a midfielder scoring 4 goals thanks to his physicality and his ability in offensive incursions. After returning to Atalanta, in the 2016/2017 season, he scored 4 goals in the first 3 Serie A games. He was signed by AC Milan in the summer of 2017.",
        "Rafael Alexandre da Conceição Leão was born in Almada to Angolan parents on 10 June 1999. Rafael started his career at Sporting Lisbon, and would go on to make his league and European debuts at a young age. In October 2017, he scored on his debut in the Taça de Portugal. In February 2018, he made his debut in the Primeira Liga and on 22 February 2018, he featured in the Europa League for the first time. He moved to LOSC Lille in the summer of 2018, where he went on to score eight goals in 26 appearances in his first season for the club. This earned him a call from AC Milan and after representing Portugal in the U20 World Cup, he signed for the Rossoneri.",
        "His professional football life began in Malmö, his hometown, where he scored his first goals in the Swedish top flight. In 2001 he moved to Ajax, kicking off a really successful start to his career: in Holland, he made his debut in European competitions and won the first trophies. Then in 2004, his arrival in Serie A: from Juventus to Inter, to consecrate himself definitively. In 2009 he moved to Barcelona, probably the most difficult parenthesis despite still managing to make a difference. So much so that a summer later, a few days after the end of the transfer market, he signed the pact with the Diavoli. \n" +
                "In San Siro, as an AC Milan player, he scored 56 goals in 85 total appearances, winning the 2010-11 championship and the Italian Super Cup in Beijing. In 2012, he moved to Paris Saint-Germain, the most lasting and rich parenthesis in terms of goals, games and triumphs. His \"tour\" in Europe is only missing England, which he discovers in 2016 thanks to the call from Manchester United. In spring 2017, a serious injury complicates the plans, keeping him off the pitch for several months. He leaves the Red Devils permanently in March 2018, flying to the Los Angeles Galaxy: this particular experience in MLS remains the last of his career. Now, again, AC Milan.")
